# Install
```shell
pip install ddcLogs
```


# BasicLog
+ Setup Logging
```python
from ddcLogs import BasicLog
logger = BasicLog(level="info").init()
logger.warning("This is a warning example")
```


# SizeRotatingLog
+ Setup Logging
    + Logs will rotate based on the file size
    + Logs will be deleted based on the `days_to_keep` variable, defaults to 30
```python
from ddcLogs import SizeRotatingLog
logger = SizeRotatingLog(
    level = "info",
    directory = "logs",
    filenames = ["app.log", "app1.log"],
    days_to_keep = 7,
    max_mbytes = 5,
    name = "app_name",
    stream_handler = True, # Add stream handler along with file handler
    show_location = False # This will show the filename and the line number where the message originated
).init()
logger.warning("This is a warning example")
```


# TimedRotatingLog
+ Setup Logging
    + Logs will rotate based on `when` variable to a `.gz` file, defaults to `midnight`
    + Logs will be deleted based on the `days_to_keep` variable, defaults to 30
    + Current 'when' events supported:
        + midnight - roll over at midnight
        + W{0-6} - roll over on a certain day; 0 - Monday
```python
from ddcLogs import TimedRotatingLog
logger = TimedRotatingLog(
    level = "info",
    directory = "logs",
    filenames = ["app.log", "app1.log"],
    days_to_keep = 7,
    when = "midnight",
    utc = True,
    name = "app_name",
    stream_handler = True, # Add stream handler along with file handler
    show_location = False # This will show the filename and the line number where the message originated
).init()
logger.warning("This is a warning example")
```
